The system automatically scans items as they pass through, verifying whether they have been properly checked out. If an unissued item is detected, the system instantly triggers an alert, helping to deter theft and unauthorized access. Seamlessly integrated with the libraryâ€™s database, the E-Secure Gate provides real-time tracking, ensuring accuracy and security. By implementing this solution, libraries can minimize losses, enhance security, and maintain a well-monitored yet user-friendly environment.",
